# Bulls_and_Cows_MIPS
The program Bulls & Cows is a word-guessing game written in MIPS assembly language. This game randomly chooses a word from a list of 100 words. The word is a real four-letter word that has no duplicate letter and all lower case. The user needs to guess what the word is. Based on the user’s guess, the result will be shown as “#a Bulls and #b Cows”, indicating the numbers of letters on the right position and on the wrong position, respectively. If the user guesses the word correctly (4 bulls), the game will end and show the total time spent, whereas if the user chooses to give up, the game will end and display the correct word.
